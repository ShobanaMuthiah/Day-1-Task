DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP 1.1 AND HTTP 2

HTTP 1.1
* High level Latency
* It keeps all requests and responses into plain text format
* Introducing persistent connection and piplining
* It operates on a sequential request-response model, where each request must be completed before the next one can be initiated.
* Head-Of-Line blocking is a significant problem with optimizing connection efficiency in it.
* It has single persistent connection to origin
* It doesn't support any multiplexing
* It relies on transport layer to avoid buffer overflow

HTTP 2
* It decreases the latency from http 1.1
* It uses binary framing layer to encapsulate all messgages in binary format
* Cutting up the information into smaller packets which increase the flexibility of data transfer.
* It establishes a single connection of objects between two machines.
* It supports multiplexing process to resolve the Head-Of-Line block in HTTP 1.1
* It allows the client and server to implement their own flow control
