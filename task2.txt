A blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

* Object is collection of properties.
* For Example:-
        
        We can imagine a Car
        It has the features of 
            1. steering wheel
            2. Accelarator
            3. Brake
            4. Clutch
            5. Engine
            6. Tires 
            7. Hand braker 
            etc..
        In this example the "Object" is set as "Car" and it's features are set as it's "Properties".

* We can create an object with 2 types
    1. using object initializer 
    2. using constructor function

* Syntax of object initializer:-
    
    var obj_name = { property_1 : value_1;
                            ..
                            ..
                            ..
                     property_n : value_n;
                    };

    Here we can denote the property names might be an identifier, or a number, or a steering

    Example:-

    var Car= { wheel: 4;
               engine: "1000cc";
               clutch: 5;
             };

* Example of using constructor functions to create an object
 
  function Car(brand,year)
  {
    this.brand=brand;
    this.year=year;     //'this' function assign values to their respective properties
  }

  assigning values to its's properties

  var MyCar = new Car("hyundai",1967);

  now the properties MyCar.brand and MyCar.year have it's respective values as 'hyundai' and '1967'
